# GLFW3 Tutorials

Code for my tutorials on using GLFW3.

## Tutorial 1: Multi-Window Tutorial

Source code for [this tutorial](http://blog.gvnott.com/2013/05/18/tutorial-multiple-windows-with-glfw3-and-glew-mx/). This tutorial shows how to get mulitpuls windows going with GLFW3 and GLEW MX.

## Extra: Multi-Threaded Demo

This code is some attempts I made to add threading to the code from Tutorial 1. The idea was to have each window run on a seperate thread.
